# Test Cases - Training Wheels Protocol Mobile Version - QAcademy

I've took the course "Introduction To Appium With Robotframework for Android Apps" from QAcademy school and along with lessons I've performed these test cases on the app. I've used the following setup:


- [x] VScode IDE
- [x] Android Visual Studio
- [x] Appium // Appium Library
- [x] Appium Inspector
- [x] Robot Framework
- [x] Python

#### Test Cases:

- It should open the main screen
- It should login successfully
- It should acces the Dialogs screen
- It should acces the Forms screen
- It should access the Avengers screen
- It should select the Python radio button
- It should check Robot Framework checkbox
- It should do a simple click
- It should do a long click
- It should select the QA spinner on the sign up form
- It should select the DevOps spinner on the sign up form
- It should remove Captain America of Avengers list
- It should move Hulk to the top of the list

After running all test cases I've got Robot Framework reports with screenshots which are a very interesting way to document all tests performed.
